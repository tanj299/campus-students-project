AllStudents makes an API request (which IS my store) for allStudents
Array gets passed from AllStudents into StudentList 
StudentList maps the array and has individual cards with student info 


Single Student gets the id from the URL bar, makes another API request from the store to the backend with that id 
Gets back single object which is the student 
Updates the state with that single student on the single student key
